Quiz: Enumerate
Use enumerate to modify the cast list so that each element contains the name followed by the character's corresponding height. For example, the first element of cast should change from "Barney Stinson" to "Barney Stinson 72".

Solution:

cast = ["Barney Stinson", "Robin Scherbatsky", "Ted Mosby", "Lily Aldrin", "Marshall Eriksen"]
heights = [72, 68, 72, 66, 76]

#Line 1: for the index of each character name in the list cast
#Line 2: Match the name from cast and height by index 0:0, 1:1, etc.
#Line 2: also accounts for adding a blank space string between the character name and height

for i, character in enumerate(cast):
    cast[i] = character + " " + str(heights[i])

print(cast)
