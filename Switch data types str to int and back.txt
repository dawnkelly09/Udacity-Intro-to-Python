In this quiz, you’ll need to change the types of the input and output data in order to get the result you want.

Calculate and print the total sales for the week from the data provided. Print out a string of the form "This week's total sales: xxx", where xxx will be the actual total of all the numbers. You’ll need to change the type of the input data in order to calculate that total.

Solution:

mon_sales = "121"
tues_sales = "105"
wed_sales = "110"
thurs_sales = "98"
fri_sales = "95"

#TODO: Print a string with this format: This week's total sales: xxx
# You will probably need to write some lines of code before the print statement.

#These lines of code convert number strings to ints and then adds them together
#This new int value is assigned to the variable "total_sales"

mon_sales = int(121)
tues_sales = int(105)
wed_sales = int(110)
thurs_sales = int(98)
fri_sales = int(95)
total_sales = (mon_sales+tues_sales+wed_sales+thurs_sales+fri_sales)

#The "+str" changes total_sales from int back to str so we have same data type 
#and can use the print function to create our new string (message)

message = "This week\'s total sales: " +str(total_sales) 

print(message)
