Write a while loop that finds the largest square number less than an integerlimit and stores it in a variable nearest_square. A square number is the product of an integer multiplied by itself, for example 36 is a square number because it equals 6*6.

For example, if limit is 40, your code should set the nearest_square to 36.


limit = 40
start = 0

#Line 1: while (start + 1) squared is less than limit, run loop
#Line 2: add one to start on each iteration
#Once (start +1) squared is >= limit, nearest square is the last start number squared

while (start+1)**2 < limit:
    start += 1
nearest_square = start**2

print(nearest_square)
