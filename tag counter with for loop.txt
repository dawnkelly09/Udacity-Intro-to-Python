Quiz: Tag Counter
Write a for loop that iterates over a list of strings, tokens, and counts how many of them are XML tags. XML is a data language similar to HTML. You can tell if a string is an XML tag if it begins with a left angle bracket "<" and ends with a right angle bracket ">". Keep track of the number of tags using the variable count.

You can assume that the list of strings will not contain empty strings.

Solution:

tokens = ['<greeting>', 'Hello World!', '</greeting>']
count = 0

count = 0

#line 1 = for each token in list "tokens"
#line 2 = if the first character of token = < and last character = >
#line 3 = add one to "count"

for token in tokens:
    if token[0] == '<' and token[-1] == '>':
        count += 1

print(count)
