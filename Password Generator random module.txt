Write a function called generate_password that selects three random words from the list of words word_list and concatenates them into a single string. Your function should not accept any arguments and should reference the global variable word_list to build the password.

(Note this will not run in a text editor without the list which is part of the course dev environment for the problem)

Solution:

#First import the `random` module

import random

#Start with an empty `word_list` which we will add to from the file

word_file = "words.txt"
word_list = []


#Line 1: uses with open to open the word_file in read mode
#Line 2: for loop --> for each line in words, do these things
#Line 3: remove white space and make everything lowercase 
#Line 4/5: if word is more than 3 letters but less than 8, add it to word_list

with open(word_file,'r') as words:
    for line in words:
	    word = line.strip().lower()
	    if 3 < len(word) < 8:
		word_list.append(word)

#Line 1: header to name the function and define any parameters
#Line 2: use random.choice to select 3 words from word_list and add them together to form one word

def generate_password():
    return random.choice(word_list) + random.choice(word_list) + random.choice(word_list)


#Print the resulting password

print(generate_password())
