Write a loop with a break statement to create a string, news_ticker, that is exactly 140 characters long. You should create the news ticker by adding headlines from the headlines list, inserting a space in between each headline. If necessary, truncate the last headline in the middle so that news_ticker is exactly 140 characters long.

Solution:

headlines = ["Local Bear Eaten by Man",
             "Legislature Announces New Laws",
             "Peasant Discovers Violence Inherent in System",
             "Cat Rescues Fireman Stuck in Tree",
             "Brave Knight Runs Away",
             "Papperbok Review: Totally Triffic"]

#This creates variable news_ticker as a blank string

news_ticker = ""

#Line 1: for each headline in headlines
#Line 2: add the headline plus one blank space to news_ticker string
#Line 3: if the length of string news_ticker is greater than or equals 140 characters
#Line 4: news_ticker = news_ticker string truncated to 140 characters
#Line 5: breaks the loop

for headline in headlines:
    news_ticker += headline + " "
    if len(news_ticker) >= 140:
        news_ticker = news_ticker[:140]
        break
    
print(news_ticker)
