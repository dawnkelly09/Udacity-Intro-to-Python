Create an HTML List

Write some code, including a for loop, that iterates over a list of strings and creates a single string, html_str, which is an HTML list. The string's first line should be the opening tag <ul>. Following that is one line per element in the source list, surrounded by <li> and </li> tags. The final line of the string should be the closing tag </ul>.

Solution:

items = ['first string', 'second string']
html_str = "<ul>\n"  # "\ n" is the character that marks the end of the line
                     # the characters that are after it in html_str are on the next line

#Line 1 = for each item in list items
#Line 2 = html_str (which is the <ul> and new line) plus <li>item</li> with a \n line break
#This line 2 adds each list item (with its <li> tags) and line break to html_str
#Line 3 adds the closing </ul>

for item in items:
    html_str += "<li>{}</li>\n".format(item)
html_str += "</ul>"

print(html_str)
