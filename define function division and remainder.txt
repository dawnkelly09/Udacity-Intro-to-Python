Quiz: readable_timedelta
Write a function named readable_timedelta. The function should take one argument, an integer days, and return a string that says how many weeks and days that is. For example, calling the function and printing the result like this:

print(readable_timedelta(10))
should output the following:

1 week(s) and 3 day(s).

Solution:

#Line 1: define the function name (readable_timedelta) and argument (days)
#Line 2: calculate weeks--use // to find how many times days divides by 7 (rounded down to whole #)
#Line 3: calculate remainder--use % to find remainder of days divided by 7 
#Line 4: use format method to create the written response when function is run

def readable_timedelta(days):
    weeks = days // 7
    remainder = days % 7
    return "{} week(s) and {} day(s).".format(weeks, remainder)


print(readable_timedelta(10))

1 week(s) and 3 day(s).
