Create Usernames

Write a for loop that iterates over the names list to create a usernames list. To create a username for each name, make everything lowercase and replace spaces with underscores.

Solution: 

names = ["Joey Tribbiani", "Monica Geller", "Chandler Bing", "Phoebe Buffay"]
usernames = []

# write your for loop here

for name in names:  
    usernames.append(name.lower().replace(" ", "_"))

#line one = for each name in the names list
#line two = items in () will be done first so-->
#line two = change to lowercase, replace space with underscore, then add each new item to usernames

print(usernames)
